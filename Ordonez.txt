This dataset comprises information regarding the ADLs performed by two users on a daily basis in their
own homes. This dataset is composed by two instances of data, each one corresponding to a different
user and summing up to 35 days of fully labelled data. Each instance of the dataset is described by
three text files, namely: description, sensors events (features), activities of the daily living (labels).
Sensor events were recorded using a wireless sensor network and data were labelled manually.
